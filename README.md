# OFF-Widescreen
This is a widescreen version of the game OFF I'm working on.

#Certain parts are not done yet, expect bugs

# How to Run
Click Code, Download ZIP, then extract the files wherever\
For Windows - run Player.exe
For Mac - use the AppBundle
For other devices - Look up how to run EasyRPG and point it towards the game directory

# What are these saves?
The saves are just leftover from me testing out the newer sections, all you should need to do is start a new game.

# Game not in Widescreen?
Go into EasyRPG settings, then Video, then set 'Resolution' to 'Widescreen (Experimental)'. After that's done, restart the game
